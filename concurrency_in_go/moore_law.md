# Moore's Law - Why it stopped being true


## What is it ?

It isn't really a law in the legal sense or even a proven theory in the scientific sense. To put it simple, roughly every two years the number of transistors on microchips will double. This quote is from 1965. In order to make processors faster transistors were added more and more. This would increse the speed and power of a integrated circuits as well as the energy spent and the required cooling mechanism to keep all of this working.


## Why is not true anymore

Transistors were kept being added while the space was slowing being reduced. There is a limit to how much space can handle so many transistors. Eventually, the energy and the resultant heat to keep all of those transistors working would be too much given that minimum space. What this means is that computers are projected to reach their limits because transistors will be unable to operate within smaller circuits at increasingly higher temperatures. This is due to the fact that cooling the transistors will require more energy than the energy that passes through the transistor itself. In sum, the result increase of power of these chips are also completly related to this points:

* Power increases as transistor density increases.
* Voltage scaling reduces power consumption.
* Voltage scaling cannot prevent leakage power loss.
* Voltage scaling is limited due to noise and/or threshold voltage.
