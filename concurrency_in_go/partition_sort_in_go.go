Write a program to sort an array of integers.
The program should partition the array into 4 parts,
each of which is sorted by a different goroutine.

Each partition should be of approximately equal size.

Then the main goroutine should merge the 4 sorted subarrays into one large sorted array.

The program should prompt the user to input a series of integers.
Each goroutine which sorts Â¼ of the array should print the subarray that it will sort.

When sorting is complete, the main goroutine should print the entire sorted list.
